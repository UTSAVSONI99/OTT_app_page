# Description

This project is an OTT (Over-the-Top) platform landing page that is slick and easy to use, giving users a smooth surfing experience. 
The website has an easy-to-use sidebar that makes it simple to navigate between its several sections, which include Home, Browse, Awards, and Library. It also provides opportunities for users to view their recently watched, favorited, and downloaded shows, as well as highlighting featured material with thorough descriptions.
Because of its emphasis on participation and accessibility, the design is perfect for streaming services.
